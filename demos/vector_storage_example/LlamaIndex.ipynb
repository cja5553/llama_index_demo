SNAP?\n","\u001b[0m\u001b[38;5;200m\u001b[1;3m[wiki_snap] Q: What is the health impact of SNAP?\n","\u001b[0m\u001b[38;5;200m\u001b[1;3m[wiki_snap] A: Access to SNAP has been found to have positive health impacts. Studies have shown that toddlers and preschoolers in households with access to food stamps have better health outcomes compared to similar children without access to food stamps. Additionally, increasing SNAP participation has been associated with lower overall and male suicide rates. Furthermore, a recent study found that users of the program aged 50 and above had slower memory loss compared to non-users. These findings suggest that SNAP plays a role in improving health outcomes for its participants.\n","\u001b[0m\u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3m[wiki_snap] A: The nutritional impact of SNAP is inconclusive. Studies have shown that SNAP participants score slightly lower on the Healthy Eating Index compared to low-income nonparticipants. However, SNAP increases the likelihood that participants will consume whole fruit. On the other hand, SNAP participation decreases participants' intake of dark green and orange vegetables by a modest amount. It is important to note that SNAP does not have nutritional standards for purchases, unlike other federal programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Critics argue that this lack of structure represents a missed opportunity for public health advancement and cost containment.\n","\u001b[0m\u001b[33;1m\u001b[1;3m[wiki_snap] A: SNAP has a positive economic impact. It is considered a counter-cyclical government assistance program, meaning it provides assistance to more low-income households during economic downturns and fewer households during economic expansions. The rise in SNAP participation during an economic downturn stimulates the economy by increasing SNAP expenditures. Studies have shown that every dollar of SNAP benefits generates economic activity, with estimates ranging from $1.73 to $1.84. SNAP expenditures also have a multiplier effect on GDP, with a $1 billion increase in SNAP expenditures resulting in a $1.79 billion increase in economic activity. Additionally, SNAP benefits can help boost the economy by putting more resources quickly into the hands of people who are likely to spend it, thus benefiting both the economy and vulnerable individuals facing hunger.\n","\u001b[0m**********\n","Trace: query\n","    |_query ->  18.549154 seconds\n","      |_llm ->  3.388158 seconds\n","      |_sub_question ->  4.777449 seconds\n","        |_query ->  4.777153 seconds\n","          |_retrieve ->  0.327232 seconds\n","            |_embedding ->  0.318537 seconds\n","          |_synthesize ->  4.449761 seconds\n","            |_llm ->  4.442156 seconds\n","      |_sub_question ->  5.696741 seconds\n","        |_query ->  5.696371 seconds\n","          |_retrieve ->  0.378889 seconds\n","            |_embedding ->  0.370423 seconds\n","          |_synthesize ->  5.317356 seconds\n","            |_llm ->  5.310349 seconds\n","      |_sub_question ->  3.790412 seconds\n","        |_query ->  3.790133 seconds\n","          |_retrieve ->  0.36048 seconds\n","            |_embedding ->  0.35287 seconds\n","          |_synthesize ->  3.429534 seconds\n","            |_llm ->  3.422326 seconds\n","      |_synthesize ->  9.457407 seconds\n","        |_llm ->  9.453757 seconds\n","**********\n"]}],"source":["response = query_engine.query(\"How does SNAP impact ones nutritional, economic and health well-being?\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":17,"status":"ok","timestamp":1692228765015,"user":{"displayName":"Charles J Alba","userId":"04453837260567781183"},"user_tz":300},"id":"QYSNG4hJ1bJF","outputId":"dcf529b2-1f31-403e-8722-8d9f7b26d284"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["SNAP has an inconclusive impact on nutritional well-being.\n","While studies have shown that SNAP participants may have slightly lower scores on the Healthy Eating Index compared to low-income nonparticipants, SNAP increases the likelihood of consuming whole fruit.\n","However, it decreases the intake of dark green and orange vegetables by a modest amount.\n","It is important to note that SNAP does not have nutritional standards for purchases.\n","In terms of economic well-being, SNAP has a positive impact.\n","It is considered a counter-cyclical government assistance program, providing assistance to more low-income households during economic downturns.\n","The rise in SNAP participation during these times stimulates the economy by increasing SNAP expenditures.\n","Studies have shown that every dollar of SNAP benefits generates economic activity, with estimates ranging from $1.\n","73 to $1.\n","84.\n","SNAP benefits also have a multiplier effect on GDP.\n","Regarding health well-being, access to SNAP has been found to have positive impacts.\n","Studies have shown that toddlers and preschoolers in households with access to SNAP have better health outcomes compared to similar children without access.\n","Increasing SNAP participation has also been associated with lower overall and male suicide rates.\n","Additionally, a recent study found that SNAP users aged 50 and above had slower memory loss compared to non-users.\n","These findings suggest that SNAP plays a role in improving health outcomes for its participants.\n"]}],"source":["print(neat_text(response))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kjxKAWgihsng"},"source":["### Example 5: Joint QA Summary Query Engine"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Hxmog47UmCf3"},"outputs":[],"source":["query_engine_builder = QASummaryQueryEngineBuilder()\n","query_engine = query_engine_builder.build_from_documents(wiki_snap)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":35738,"status":"ok","timestamp":1692228802751,"user":{"displayName":"Charles J Alba","userId":"04453837260567781183"},"user_tz":300},"id":"jc9OCvC9mJNq","outputId":"e355d488-10bb-4197-b4bb-6496d3612700"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, has several impacts.

benefit amount, expanding eligibility criteria, and providing more flexibility in how benefits could be used.\n","As a result, the immediate implication of the 1977 Food Stamp Act was increased access to food and nutrition for low-income households.\n","In the long-term, research has shown that access to SNAP benefits during early life leads to positive health and economic outcomes, such as lower
